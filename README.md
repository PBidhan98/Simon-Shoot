# Simon Shoot

1) You can press any key to start the game. 
2) It shows the tile's pattern which you have to remember for being in the game. 
3) As you go up level by level, then the patterns will become more difficult to remember.
4) At one point of time, you are going to screw up.
5) GAME OVER and you loose :(
6) To restart the game you can press any key. 

Play and enjoy the GAME :)

Happy Coding:)
